# Viṣṇu Purāṇa full-corpus audit — 2026-09-22

Full-corpus baseline commit: `c8ca1aab6e791010c41287c5738d3989d522811a` (2026-09-22); chapter-level delta added below.

Scope: all 126 Viṣṇu Purāṇa chapter routes on `main`, using the cited Vishvas/Vasuki source paths recorded in each route. All inspection and writes were performed through the remote GitHub workspace; nothing was run locally or in a local browser.

## What passed structurally

- 126 chapter routes were present.
- 6,400 verse articles were present after restoring six omitted Book 4 articles: 4.6.8, 4.6.30, 4.6.50, 4.7.5, 4.8.17, and 4.19.18.
- Verse IDs were contiguous and unique across all routes after those restorations.
- Every article had a Sanskrit block, a main translation block, and a Transliteration control.
- No `source range` labels remained.
- No leading ellipsis/marker scaffolding remained in the verse articles.
- No legacy WFW row retained a copied ordinary translation tail. The VP WFW markup was standardized to the verified one-mapping-per-line layout.
- No embedded three-digit source-footnote numerals remained in the audited lexical/source fields.
- The restored six articles contain source-backed Sanskrit, transliteration, direct lexical rows, and the correct no-commentary or Śrīdhara state.

## Word-for-word status

The requirement is not complete.

Following the verified Book 6 Chapter 8 release, 3,565 of 6,400 articles have a main-text lexical layer; 2,835 remain missing:

| Book | Articles | Main lexical WFW present | Still missing |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 1,407 | 1,198 | 209 |
| 2 | 787 | 710 | 77 |
| 3 | 837 | 837 | 0 |
| 4 | 1,354 | 61 | 1,293 |
| 5 | 1,517 | 695 | 822 |
| 6 | 498 | 64 | 434 |

Books 1–2 contain some WFW controls with Śrīdhara material; those are not automatically counted as complete main-text WFW. Books 4–6 still need genuine Sanskrit-first reconstruction beyond the chapters already rebuilt; the current reverse-order pass has now rebuilt Book 6 Chapter 8 (64/64 main lexical layers), alongside the previously rebuilt Book 5 chapters. A control’s presence is not being counted as semantic completion.

## Śrīdhara and control status

After replacing Book 6 Chapter 8's previous 24 Śrīdhara controls and 41 no-commentary states with 31 source-mapped Śrīdhara controls and 33 exact no-commentary states, the repository contains 3,577 articles with a Śrīdhara Sanskrit control and 3,140 explicit `No commentary.` states. The structural control check confirms that the published Transliteration controls are present, but it does not prove that every IAST string or every Śrīdhara translation is semantically correct.

## Required next work

Rebuild the missing main WFW one complete chapter at a time from the exact displayed Sanskrit, with every phrase mapped directly, then independently check the corresponding Śrīdhara Sanskrit and English. Do not mark a chapter complete merely because its route or button exists. Do not replace missing lexical work with the ordinary translation, a placeholder, or a generated paragraph.

This audit therefore records the site as structurally repaired in the areas above but semantically incomplete for the remaining 2,835 main WFW articles. Chapter-by-chapter lexical rebuilding remains open.


## Incremental reverse-order chapter audit — 2026-09-23

Book 6 Chapter 8 has been rebuilt from its final verse backwards and published as a complete chapter. The dynamic Contents page already generates all eight Book 6 chapter links, including this route, so no Contents-file change was needed.

- 64/64 contiguous verse articles, Sanskrit blocks, English translations, Word-for-word controls, and Transliteration controls.
- 832 main-text lexical mappings and 113 Śrīdhara lexical mappings; each entry pairs Sanskrit, IAST, and a concise gloss.
- 31 source-mapped Śrīdhara Sanskrit/commentary blocks and 33 exact `No commentary.` states.
- Main IAST and supplied Śrīdhara IAST were checked against their displayed Devanāgarī; the verse 6.8.15 spelling and lexical gloss were corrected to `पुंसां (puṃsām)`.
- No placeholder word-for-word messages, ellipses, displayed source-range labels, missing verse IDs, or unbalanced HTML remain in this chapter.

This is an incremental chapter audit, not a claim that the rest of the 6,400-verse corpus is complete. The next reverse-order target is Book 6 Chapter 7, beginning with its source's final verse, 6.7.106.


## User-directed Book 1 completion pass — 2026-09-24

A direct current-branch audit finds 761/1,407 Book 1 verses with an explicit main-text word-for-word section before this pass. The earlier 1,198 figure counted visible controls, including pending panels and Śrīdhara-only material; it is not a verified main-text lexical count. This correction leaves 646 Book 1 verses requiring main-text mapping.

### Book 1, Chapter 18

- 43/43 contiguous verse articles have a main-text lexical map, with Sanskrit and IAST panels and source/commentary content retained.
- Added 43 Chapter 9-style word-for-word sections using the paired-script row layout and matching control sizes.
- Corrected 1.18.3 from `प्रविज्ञातम् (pravijñātam)` to source-backed `अविज्ञातम् (avijñātam)`; the pinned mūla and numbered witness agree.
- Source witness: `vishvAsa/purANam_vaiShNavam` content commit `fc117aa4514dfd4e4840037aeb3ca825ba030b05`; mūla `viShNu-purANam/viShNu-chitta-TIkA/mUlam_me/01/18.md`, blob `4247989218affbd077c77bf960a0b09e3295da1d`; numbered witness `viShNu-purANam/goraxapura-pAThaH/hindy-anuvAdaH/01/18.md`, blob `8777450e4dba39b5e270b7d3d32cdef8de92f5bd`.
- Book 1 status after this release: 804/1,407 main-text maps complete; 603 remain.


Chapter 18 lexical refinement after read-back: 1.18.33 now separates `hṛdi āste` from `hariḥ īśvaraḥ`; 1.18.38's contextual phrase gloss is clarified as `I do not regard them as evil`.


## User-directed Books 1–2 re-audit and Chapter 21 release — 2026-09-24

Pre-release branch audited: `e53270cb5ef7bb4eafc65a3898fdb49683b7ec54`.

The Chapter 9 fonts and exact pill-control stylesheet are linked from all 38 Book 1–2 pages. Current focused panel-presence counts after the Chapter 21 release:

| Book | Verse articles | Main-text panel marker | No main-text panel marker |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 1,407 | 943 | 464 |
| 2 | 787 | 710 | 77 |

These counts identify panel presence only. Other chapters still require verse-by-verse semantic review; some existing panels may contain commentary or running translation instead of lexical mappings. Book 1, Chapters 20 and 19 add 39 and 86 completed panels, respectively, to the pre-release total.

| Book | Chapter | Verses without a main-text panel |
|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | 11 | 57 |
| 1 | 12 | 95 |
| 1 | 13 | 94 |
| 1 | 14 | 48 |
| 1 | 15 | 154 |
| 1 | 16 | 16 |
| 2 | 1 | 8 |
| 2 | 4 | 5 |
| 2 | 7 | 2 |
| 2 | 8 | 32 |
| 2 | 13 | 30 |

### Book 1, Chapter 21

- 41/41 contiguous verse articles have a main-text lexical map in paired Devanāgarī/IAST rows: 476 mappings, each with a concise gloss.
- Main-text IAST was checked against the displayed Sanskrit; all word-row pairs were checked for script/transliteration agreement. All 41 Word-for-word controls are present, with no pending messages or empty lists.
- The previously missing panels for 1.21.1–14 are complete. Existing main-text maps for 1.21.15–41 were reviewed and rebuilt in Sanskrit order. Commentary and no-commentary controls were retained.
- Sources pinned at upstream commit `fc117aa4514dfd4e4840037aeb3ca825ba030b05`: mūla `viShNu-purANam/viShNu-chitta-TIkA/mUlam_me/01/21.md` (blob `18c1791300db9d2cdcd2b542fb99e997f723a168`); numbered witness `viShNu-purANam/goraxapura-pAThaH/hindy-anuvAdaH/01/21.md` (blob `dea16ef42693026bc6c28a96a4271c7aa4f13caa`); Śrīdhara `viShNu-purANam/shrIdhara-viShNu-chittau/1/21_prahlAda-vaMsha-kathanam.md` (blob `f3306d685d30f0223e97f5e1e03e751e4600e6ae`); English cross-check `viShNu-purANam/viShNu-chitta-TIkA/en/01/21.md` (blob `5dc0209c0e5cb46981bd50e4542800a49ad4ddf4`).
- The page note records these textual decisions: 1.21.1 uses witness `saṃhlāda-putra` against mūla `prahlāda-putra`; 1.21.2, .3, .5, .7, and .11 retain selected mūla readings; 1.21.9 and .12 correct apparent mūla transcription errors with witness support; 1.21.13 retains mūla `vivardhana`; 1.21.15 adopts witness `sattva`; 1.21.24 adopts witness `vallī/tṛṇa`; 1.21.29 retains `putratve` against `pitṛtve`; 1.21.35 adopts `taṃ`; and 1.21.40 adopts `cakre` while retaining mūla `adri`.

### Book 1, Chapter 20

- 39/39 contiguous verse articles now have full source-backed Sanskrit, English translations, word-for-word maps, and main transliteration.
- The Chapter 9 reader layout is used for every WFW panel: 464 rows pair a Devanāgarī form, its IAST transliteration, and a concise gloss.
- Restored incomplete main text in 1.20.18–20, .23–24, .28, and .34; corrected other source-level mismatches including 1.20.1, .4, .6–7, .9–16, .20, .22–24, .30, .32, .38–39.
- 1.20.24's English was corrected to say that Prahlāda asks for his father to be freed from the sin of hating him as a devotee of Viṣṇu.

### Book 1, Chapter 19

- 86/86 contiguous articles have a reviewed word-for-word panel, with 1,022 paired Sanskrit/IAST/gloss rows.
- Main Sanskrit and IAST were corrected for clear source transcription errors, including the missing fire element in 1.19.68; all 86 translations remain present.

- Book 1 focused panel markers now total 943/1,407; 464 remain. Book 2 remains 710/787 with 77 remaining. These are panel-presence counts and do not certify chapters whose existing panels have not been semantically reviewed.

Book 1–2 semantic completion remains open. The panel gaps above and the other present-but-unreviewed panels must still be checked chapter by chapter.


## User-directed Books 1–2 focus — Chapter 16 release — 2026-09-24

Book 1 Chapter 16 is complete and read back on `main`. The 16 contiguous verse articles now each contain a source-checked Sanskrit text, full English translation, Chapter 9-style paired Devanāgarī/IAST word-for-word rows, and a matching IAST control. The chapter has 201 lexical rows and no placeholder panels. Existing Śrīdhara contextual material was retained.

The Sanskrit note pins the mūla text, numbered witness, Śrīdhara Sanskrit and commentary, and English cross-check at upstream commit `fc117aa4514dfd4e4840037aeb3ca825ba030b05`. Material choices include mūla `dantabhāgaiḥ ... nipīḍitaḥ` at 1.16.8 against the numbered/Śrīdhara `dantabhūmim ... nirūpitaḥ`; mūla `ghoraṃ` at .10 against witness `aho`; witness-supported `kaḥ samarthaḥ` at .12; and mūla `vipakṣe cāpi` at .15 against witness `vipakṣā api`. The page records the remaining source-supported corrections.

Structural panel status at the Chapter 16 release: Book 1 had 959/1,407 markers (448 without a marker); Book 2 had 710/787 (77 without a marker). Book 1’s gaps then were Chapters 11–15: 57, 95, 94, 48, and 154 verses. Book 2’s gaps were Chapters 1, 4, 7, 8, and 13: 8, 5, 2, 32, and 30. Existing panels outside the reviewed chapters still need semantic audit.

- Word-for-word display coverage is now complete across Books 1 and 2: Book 1 has 1,407/1,407 verse panels, and Book 2 has 787/787. These counts establish panel coverage, not full semantic review of inherited glosses.


## User-directed Books 1–2 Word-for-word layout completion — 2026-09-25

- Book 1: 1,407/1,407 verse panels; 5,615 rows added across 12 migrated pages.
- Book 2: 787/787 verse panels; this release adds 2,407 rows to 378 verses across Chapters 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16. Chapters 10 and 11 have per-token rows from corrected displayed Sanskrit; remaining migrated chapters carry forward source-map phrase groupings.
- All migrated pages use the Chapter 9 shared stylesheet and its 12px, 4px × 10px pill-button rule. English translations, Śrīdhara sections, and “No commentary” notices remain unchanged; the Śrīdhara maps were preserved.
- Numbered-witness source corrections in Chapters 10–11 are recorded in the completion guide at upstream commit `fc117aa4514dfd4e4840037aeb3ca825ba030b05` (Chapter 10 blob `99f8bf9ee439a9c9dd954ab575db1feb819a8ff6`; Chapter 11 blob `fb0af6e5edb8cf611ee4dc4da090421d24fec88e`).
- Layout coverage is complete for Books 1–2; inherited phrase-level glosses outside the per-token-reviewed pages remain candidates for a separate semantic audit.


## Current structural and reader audit — 2026-09-26

The current-branch scan covered all 126 routes and 6,400 verse articles. Every article had nonempty Sanskrit and English fields plus a Transliteration control. Verse IDs were contiguous from 1 through each chapter's final verse, and every verse target listed in a Contents section resolved. Translation and transliteration correctness were not established by these presence checks.

| Book | Articles | Nonempty WFW panels | Missing WFW panel | Placeholder panels |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 1,407 | 1,407 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 787 | 783 | 0 | 4 |
| 3 | 837 | 837 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 1,354 | 61 | 1,293 | 0 |
| 5 | 1,517 | 671 | 846 | 0 |
| 6 | 498 | 64 | 434 | 0 |
| **Total** | **6,400** | **3,823** | **2,573** | **4** |

“Nonempty WFW panel” is a DOM-presence count only; it does not assert that each lexical map accounts for every Sanskrit word. The Book 2 placeholders are 2.4.96, 2.6.40–41, and 2.8.34. Book 4–6 gaps are the next source-based completion targets in descending book order, beginning at 6.7.106. The reader update applies the Chapter 1 theme to all routes. The 3.8.7 map now includes the omitted vocative `rājendra` (“O king”).


## User-sampled Book 3, Chapter 4 markup and content repair — 2026-09-26

- Rechecked all 26 verses against the pinned mūla, numbered witness, Śrīdhara, and English cross-check. Restored missing third-pāda translation and lexical material at 3.4.25; corrected 3.4.1 English/commentary wording and other source-backed readings recorded in the page note.
- Chapter coverage: 26/26 English translations, 26 main-text Word-for-word controls, 238 paired lexical rows, 26 Transliteration controls, 22 supplied Śrīdhara states, and four exact “No commentary.” states.
- Removed the extra closing divs in all 26 Word-for-word panels; fixed the 3.4.21 Transliteration reveal and outer `main` closure. Chapter 1 and 3.4 share identical stylesheet/font links and reader classes. Source validation passed; live visual rendering was not verified in a browser.
- Structural scan before this repair: 1,635/6,400 article nodes had div-count imbalance. This release fixes 26; 1,609 remain (Book 1: 8; Book 2: 682; Book 3: 680; Book 4: 61; Book 5: 178; Book 6: 0). This is markup-only; the semantic audit across the other chapters remains open. Whole-corpus WFW panel presence is 3,823/6,400, with 2,573 missing panels and four explicit placeholders, as recorded above.
- Source blobs are pinned in the chapter note at upstream commit `fc117aa4514dfd4e4840037aeb3ca825ba030b05`: mūla `9140193c63be14daf9616d617a436616021b2880`, numbered witness `59f12fc67520cf05689f452f5e9147c0f12a28d3`, Śrīdhara `add296b89589d37e9a249ebcb5c67b3f342d456b`, English `9b6296cb41622e4d0500de8547251e5cd189abcb`.
